# Task 6 - Password Strength Evaluation Report

## Objective

The goal of this task was to understand what makes a password **strong** or **weak** by testing a variety of passwords using an online password strength checker and analyzing the outcomes.

---

## Process Overview

### 🔍 Step 1: Select Passwords

Four passwords of different styles and complexities were selected for testing:
- MaximumHello@#87894885
- myname777@#
- adminadmin12
- admin admin

Each password varied in length, use of symbols, repetition, and predictability.

### ⚙️ Step 2: Evaluate Using Online Tool

The selected passwords were tested using:
- [passwordmonster.com](https://passwordmonster.com)

The tool evaluated password strength and provided insights based on:
- Length
- Character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Predictability
- Common usage

### 📊 Step 3: Analyze Results

| Password             | Strength    | Key Observations                                     |
|----------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| MaximumHello@#87894885 | Very Strong | Long, diverse characters used                       |
| myname777@#          | Medium      | Shorter but includes symbols and numbers            |
| adminadmin12         | Weak        | Predictable, lacks symbols                          |
| admin admin          | Very Weak   | Common phrase, includes space, no numbers or symbols|

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

- **Strong passwords** are typically:
  - 12–14+ characters long
  - Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Not based on predictable or common words
  - Not reused across multiple sites
  - Not based on personal information

- **Examples of good passwords**:
  - `RedTiger#Skate44!`
  - `Lime_Cloud93*Rocket`

---

## 🔐 Tips for Better Security

1. Use **passphrases** or unrelated word combinations.
2. Avoid **patterns** like `123456`, `adminadmin`, or `qwerty`.
3. Use a **password manager** to generate and store secure passwords.
4. Always enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** where possible.
